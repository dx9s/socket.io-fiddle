make sure to run 'sh generate.sh' and press enter a lot of times 
to create self-signed certificate/key before running 'node server.js' !

Then open browser to https://localhost:3001 and the server will crash. You
will need to accept the certificate warnings (firefox will allow you to do it)
as it is a self-signed (unknown) certificate for testing purposes.

You will get the following:
server listening on port 3001
connect xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
node: ../src/util-inl.h:196: TypeName* node::Unwrap(v8::Local<v8::Object>) [with TypeName = node::TLSWrap]: Assertion `(object->InternalFieldCount()) > (0)' failed.
Aborted
